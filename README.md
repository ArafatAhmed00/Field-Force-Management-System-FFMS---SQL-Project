Field Force Management System (FFMS) - SQL Project
Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a database system for a fictitious Field Force Management System (FFMS). The system models a hierarchical structure of a sales team organized from zone to territory levels. It includes robust data handling, queries, and stored procedures to simulate real-world scenarios such as performance tracking, data analysis, and management reporting.
Objectives

    To design and implement a database for managing sales team data at different organizational levels (zones, territories, etc.).
    To insert, query, and manipulate data using SQL.
    To create stored procedures for efficient and reusable database operations.
    To simulate realistic operations of a field force management system.

Dataset
FFMS.xlsx

    Represents a fictitious dataset for the sales team, structured hierarchically from zones to territories.
    Key attributes include:
        Zone and Territory information.
        Team member details.
        Sales performance metrics.

Key Features

    Database Design:
        Designed a relational database to model the FFMS hierarchy.
        Includes tables for zones, territories, team members, and sales performance.

    Data Insertion:
        Populated the database using SQL scripts.
        Ensured data consistency and referential integrity.

    SQL Queries:
        Wrote complex SQL queries to analyze sales performance and generate insights.
        Included use of joins, subqueries, aggregations, and conditional logic.

    Stored Procedures:
        Created stored procedures for common operations:
            Inserting new data.
            Generating reports by zone or territory.
            Calculating performance metrics.
        Ensured modularity and reusability of code.

Files in the Repository

    FFMS.xlsx:
        Contains the data idea for the fictitious sales team.

    SQL Scripts:
        SQLQueryProject1.sql: Basic queries for data exploration and analysis.
        SQLQueryProject2.sql: Advanced queries with joins and subqueries.
        SQLQueryProject3.sql: Queries for sales performance metrics.
        SQLQueryProject4.sql: Scripts for reporting and zone-level summaries.
        SQLQuerySpProjetInsertData.sql: Stored procedures for inserting data and automating operations.

Usage

    Database Setup:
        Create a database named FFMS in your SQL environment.
        Run the SQL scripts to set up the schema and populate the database.

    Run Queries:
        Use the provided SQL scripts to analyze and manage data.
        Execute stored procedures for automated operations.

    Data Exploration:
        Use SQL queries to explore the dataset and generate insights.

Tools and Technologies

    Database: SQL Server or any RDBMS of your choice.
    Language: Structured Query Language (SQL).
    Dataset: Simulated data for FFMS.

Key Insights

    The hierarchical organization from zones to territories allows detailed performance tracking.
    Stored procedures enhance efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.
    Complex queries provide actionable insights for decision-making.

Instructions for Use

    1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FFMS-SQL-Project.git
    2. Open your SQL Server Management Studio (or preferred RDBMS).
    Run the scripts in the following order:
        SQLQuerySpProjetInsertData.sql (for inserting initial data).
        Other query scripts as needed for analysis and reporting.
